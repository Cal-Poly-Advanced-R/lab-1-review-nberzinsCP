## Data
```{r,message=FALSE}
library(here)
OscarsDemo = read.csv(here('Oscars-demographics-DFE.csv'))
```


## Part One
```{r}
qq_func <- function(vec) {
  #sort the vector in decreasing order
  x = sort(vec, decreasing = T)
  mean_x = mean(x)
  sd_x = sd(x)
  len_x = length(x)
  
  #create and sort a normal random vector of equal length, mean, and sd as x
  y = sort(rnorm(len_x, mean_x, sd_x), decreasing = T)
  
  #return qqplot
  return(plot(x, y, main = 'QQ-plot of x'))
  
}

#Using real data
qq_func(OscarsDemo$year_of_award)

#Using simulated data
qq_func(rgamma(441, shape = 2, scale = 15))
